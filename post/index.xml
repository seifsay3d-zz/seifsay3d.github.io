      <description>1 year ago we started writing @yard using symfony2 for the backend and twigs for templating. Having been constantly changing and evolving lots of code were written and the code base grew. Maintaining the code base became difficult and very time consuming. So we decided to quit on the &amp;ldquo;old-school&amp;rdquo; client-server app and move towards a SPA[link to spa]. We had to migrate our current system to SPA and also keep writing new features so they had to be done simultaneously.</description>

      <description>Declarative programming is often referred to with Imperative programming. Before diving in deeper lets make sure the difference is clear. Imperative programming is when you tell the computer how to perform a task by giving it a set of instruction. Declarative programming is when you tell the computer what you want to be done without having to worry about how is it going to be done.
A nice analogy is if someone asks where do you live?</description>
