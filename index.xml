      <description>Declarative programming is often referred to with Imperative programming. Before diving in deeper lets make sure the difference is clear. Imperative programming is when you tell the computer how to perform a task by giving it a set of instruction. Declarative programming is when you tell the computer what you want to be done without having to worry about how is it going to be done.
A nice analogy is if someone asks where do you live?</description>
